# docker-webserver
Our optimized production web-server setup based on docker

# THESE DOCS ARE A WORK IN PROGRESS

![No volumes Docker Visualization](docker-vis-novols.png)

## This setup has been used for most of our web servers for more than 6 years.
we have perfect scores on various webpage and performance tests
There are literally thousands of sites using this platform, from an online shop with more than 35 000 active customers to a simple blog.
In 2020 nginx + php-fpm was replaced with openlitespeed due to the massive performance advantage wordpress has with lscache.
Everything is optimized and the config values used are derived by years of testing, tweaking and observing real world data.

### Recommended setup:
VM / VPS (as a rule, always run a vm instead of baremetal, makes it easy to upgrade and do maintenance)
Fresh/clean UBUNTU LTS configured with the xshok-ubuntu-docker-host.sh script https://github.com/extremeshok/xshok-docker
Project run from the /datastore dir.

### Notes:
.env is generated on first install, as the passwords are always randomised.
there is no need to configure or edit the docker-compose.yml
all administration is done via xshok-admin.sh
files are saved into the volumes dir

### Recommended VM:
2 vcpu, 4GB ram (2GB can be used), NVME storage (webservers need nvme, sata ssd is too slow and hdd is pointless)

# xshok-admin.sh
used to control and manage the webserver, add domains, databases, ssl etc.
